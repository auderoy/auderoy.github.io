<p>I read 105 books this year. These were the best of them. (8 nonfiction, 8 fiction)</p>
  
<p><b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733573-reasons-to-stay-alive">Reasons to Stay Alive</a> by Matt Haig</b></p>

	<!--<div class="quote"><p>You will one day experience joy that matches this pain.</p></div>-->

	<p>On anxiety and depression.</p>

	<p>This was the first time I took out sticky tabs for a book that wasn’t assigned for school: blue for where I saw myself, green for where I saw someone else, yellow for interesting perspectives, experiences, metaphors that I hadn’t previously considered or that I simply hadn’t heard articulated in that specific way until now. No doubt I will be flipping through it again and again.</p>

	<p>It’s important to sit with depression and acknowledge it; you can’t deny it, you can’t wish it away. But when you talk to someone about something like this, there’s an impulse to respond. A book simply lets you be.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50196744-know-my-name">Know My Name</a> by Chanel Miller</b></p>

	<!--<div class="quote"><p>Victims exist in a society that tells us our purpose is to be an inspiring story. But sometimes the best we can do is tell you we’re still here, and that should be enough. Denying darkness does not bring anyone closer to the light.</p></div>-->

	<p>On the Stanford Rape Case.</p>

	<p>Currently in this political/social/cultural climate, there’s lots of conversation around sexual assault, which is amazing, but Chanel’s voice cuts through the frighteningly repetitive stories of sexual assault and adds something new and nuanced to the conversation. She has a certain grace, and is so honest and artful with her words. That’s not to say that she shies from the dark, confusing, messy parts of humanity. Far from it. She let every emotion in. This is a story of trauma and demons, healing and miracles.</p>

	<p>It’s the first book I can recall that I’ve loved and that I’ve had a hard time picking back up in between sittings. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5y3wdggKk8/">That’s ok</a>.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29780253-born-a-crime">Born a Crime</a> by Trevor Noah</b></p>

	<!--<div class="quote"><p>In America you had the forced removal of the native onto reservations coupled with slavery followed by segregation. Imagine all three of those things happening to the same group of people at the same time. That was apartheid.</p></div>-->

	<p>On growing up in South Africa during apartheid.</p>

	<p>The historical facts about apartheid, Trevor Noah’s personal anecdotes from childhood, and the little life lessons from his superhero of a mom all tied together, making this memoir much more than just an anthology of childhood experiences. In 300 pages, he packed in so much about himself, apartheid, race, mixed identity, religion, poverty, crime, and domestic violence. This was such an emotional and educational read, serious and funny in all the right places.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38746485-becoming">Becoming</a> by Michelle Obama</b></p>

	<!--<div class="quote"><p>Now I think it’s one of the most useless questions an adult can ask a child—What do you want to be when you grow up? As if growing up is finite. As if at some point you become something and that’s the end.</p></div>-->

	<p>Michelle Obama—career woman, wife, First Lady. Told in three parts: “Becoming Me,” “Becoming Us,” “Becoming More.”</p>

	<p>Smart, strong, driven, perceptive, and an excellent story teller, Michelle Obama wove together her values, her accomplishments, personal anecdotes, and social issues seamlessly, avoiding sounding too preachy, accessible to even those who aren’t the most politically minded.</p>

	<p>An inspiration to all of us to have bigger hearts, reach bigger goals, and keep moving forward. Always becoming.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43885003-this-is-going-to-hurt">This Is Going to Hurt</a> by Adam Kay</b></p>

	<!--<div class="quote"><p>Later, I realize there actually would be a way to practice the exact kind of small motor skills I need ahead of time. I text my mom to ask if she by any chance still has that game of Operation tucked away in a drawer.</p>
	<p>She replies to say she’s found it. She also has a Magic 8-Ball, she tells me, in case I need it for my diagnoses.</p></div>-->

	<p>Diary entries of a medical resident.</p>

	<p>HAHAHAH. Short, punchy, hilarious, completely entertaining, plus an unexpectedly informative and insightful look into the health-care system. For fans of <i>Scrubs</i>. A true joy to read.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43126457-trick-mirror">Trick Mirror</a> by Jia Tolentino</b></p>

	<!--<div class="quote"><p>I was learning that in the twenty-first century it would sometimes be impossible to differentiate between the pretext for an experience, the record of that experience, and the experience itself.</p></div>-->

	<p>Cultural criticism on American identity, culture, technology, politics, and discourse.</p>

	<p>When I initially finished reading this collection, I was a bit underwhelmed, finding the essays a mixed bag—some too dense, some inconclusive. But nevertheless, I could not get this book out of my mind. So I bought the book (I had borrowed an ecopy for my first read) and went on a deep dive, marking up quotes and outlining each essay to help myself process them. Now I find myself referencing Tolentino all the time.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37976541-bad-blood">Bad Blood</a> by John Carreyrou</b></p>

	<!--<div class="quote"><p>Hyping your product to get funding while concealing your true progress and hoping that reality will eventually catch up to the hype continues to be tolerated in the tech industry.</p></div>-->

	<p>On disgraced Silicon Valley startup Theranos (founder and CEO: Elizabeth Holmes).</p>

	<p>Holmes promised to revolutionise the medical industry with a machine that would significantly improve blood testing, conning investors, FDA officials, and her own employees. A fascinating account by the man himself who first broke the story to the public in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>.</p>

	<p>For more Theranos content, check out the podcast miniseries <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-dropout/id1449500734">The Dropout</a> (super bingeable) and HBO documentary <a href="https://www.hbo.com/documentaries/the-inventor-out-for-blood-in-silicon-valley">The Inventor</a>.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35068432-i-ll-be-gone-in-the-dark">I'll Be Gone in the Dark</a> by Michelle McNamara</b></p>

	<p>On the Golden State Killer.</p>

	<p>McNamara’s colleagues said it best, “Michelle always found the perfect balance between the typical extremes of the genre. She didn’t flinch from evoking key elements of horror and yet avoided lurid overindulgence in grisly details, as well as sidestepping self-righteous justice crusading or victim hagiography… She had a nuance one doesn’t normally encounter in true crime.”</p>

	<p>It was haunting that at the time of publication, the case remained unsolved. I’m glad that the GSK was caught by the time I started reading the book. Otherwise, I would have had trouble sleeping at night.</p>

	<p>For more GSK content, check out <a href="https://myfavoritemurder.com/1-my-firstest-murder/">this episode</a> of the <i>My Favorite Murder</i> podcast.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34273236-little-fires-everywhere">Little Fires Everywhere</a> by Jia Tolentino</b></p>

	<!--<div class="quote"><p>But there would be love, too, so much love. With that, you could get by with so little.</p></div>-->

	<p>A wandering mother-daughter pair end up in the suburbs, shaking up the carefully ordered community.</p>

	<p><i>Little Fires Everywhere</i> was a slow burn. The characters were introduced like dolls to be moved to a script, each one fulfilling a designated role in the community, a sort of storytelling from a distance. As the story went on, the characters came to life and unraveled, stripped from who they were in terms of other people, no longer mom, daughter, sister, neighbour, or whatever, but known for their own self.</p>

	<p>This book came to me at exactly the right time. I wouldn’t be exaggerating to say that this book healed me in a small way.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41880044-the-most-fun-we-ever-had">The Most Fun We Ever Had</a> by Claire Lombardo</b></p>

	<!--<div class="quote"><p>Everyone thinks I know what I’m doing but I actually have no idea what I’m doing and that’s the cruelest trick the universe plays on people who have their shit together, little one; the people who seem like they have it together are the most overlooked, because everyone thinks those people never need anything, but everyone needs things.</p></div>-->

	<p>This story follows an ordinary suburban family whose comfortable rhythm is shaken by the arrival of the 15yo son one of the daughters gave up in a closed adoption.</p>

	<p>This family saga particularly resonated with me because I saw aspects of myself in each member of the family—the lost parts of each most of all.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40409102-this-is-how-it-always-is">This Is How It Always Is</a> by Laurie Frankel</b></p>

	<!--<div class="quote"><p>You never know. You only guess. This is how it always is… You never have enough information. You don’t get to see the future… It’s impossible. It’s heartbreaking. It’s maddening. But there’s no alternative.</p></div>-->

	<p>A heart-wrenching story of raising a trans child.</p>

	<p>You don’t have to be trans or a parent to relate to this story. There are questions about identity we all grapple with as we navigate our place in the world amidst so much uncertainty.</p>

	<p>How do you ask the world to accept you for who you are when you’re still trying to figure out who that is? How do you go forth in the world boldly when you know it is not always kind? Why is being different this way so different from being different that way?</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40121959-miracle-creek">Miracle Creek</a> by Angie Kim</b></p>

	<!--<div class="quote"><p>Good things and bad—every friendship and romance formed, every accident, every illness—resulted from the conspiracy of hundreds of little things, in and of themselves inconsequential.</p></div>-->

	<p>A courtroom mystery following a fatal explosion at a special treatment center, as well as a story of motherhood, taking a typical mystery and blending it with literary fiction.</p>

	<p>As the trial unfolded day by day, I was gripped in suspense. The piece-by-piece reveal was executed in a way that didn’t feel contrived, as it easily could have been. By the end, all the pieces were in place so the reveal wasn’t too much of a shock, but I didn’t mind.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41940236-the-whisper-man">The Whisper Man</a> by Alex North</b></p>

	<!--<div class="quote"><p>Small triumphs on terrible days. You had to cling to them.</p></div>-->

	<p>The Whisper Man lures his victims out by whispering at their windows at night. He was caught 20 years ago. So who’s responsible for the latest crime bearing an unnerving resemblance to his? Who’s next?</p>

	<p>This thriller hit all my creepy triggers. The creepy sensory descriptions were so vivid—not just visual imagery, but oral imagery too, hence Whisper Man. Creepy men. Creepy voices. Creepy kids. Creepy kids are the worst, man.</p>

	<p>It doesn’t help that I just came off reading <i>I’ll Be Gone in the Dark</i> when I started this, and the Whisper Man’s MO was quite similar to the GSK’s, so the Whisper Man really came to life for me!</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42046112-recursion">Recursion</a> by Blake Crouch</b></p>

	<!--<div class="quote"><p>Life with a cheat code isn’t life. Our existence isn’t something to be engineered or optimized for the avoidance of pain. That’s what it is to be human—the beauty and the pain, each meaningless without the other.</p></div>-->

	<p>Memories are changing and people are remembering lives they’ve never lived.</p>

	<p>Changed memories and changing realities are tricky to write about. It’s easy to get confused in an “everything was not what it seemed” kinda story, where memories, realities, and timelines keep flipping.</p>

	<p>Yet Recursion was executed so well; I was able to follow the concepts and stay engaged, and still continue to be surprised as events unfurled. As mind-bending for me as the first time I watched <i>Inception</i>.</p>

<p><b>The Grishaverse books by Leigh Bardugo</b></p>

	<!--<div class="quote"><p>What about the nobodies and the nothings, the invisible girls? We learn to hold our heads as if we wear crowns. We learn to wring magic from the ordinary. That was how you survived when you weren’t chosen, when there was no royal blood in your veins. When the world owed you nothing, you demanded something of it anyway.</p></div>-->

	<p>This YA fantasy series was. an. experience. to. read. I haven’t been so consumed by a series since middle school. Of the <i><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10194157-shadow-and-bone">Shadow and Bone</a></i> trilogy, <i><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23437156-six-of-crows">Six of Crows</a></i> duology, and <i><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36307634-king-of-scars">King of Scars</a></i> duology that make up this series, the <i>SoC</i> duology was definitely the standout, in which a crew of thugs and thieves are hired for an impossible heist. All the characters were fully fleshed out and all of them stole my heart; Jesper is my guyyy.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6257499-breakfast-at-tiffany-s">Breakfast at Tiffany's</a> by Truman Capote</b></p>

	<!--<div class="quote"><p>I don’t mean I’d mind being rich and famous. That’s very much on my schedule, and someday I’ll try to get around to it.</p></div>-->

	<p>A novella that is more of a character study than a plot-driven story. It follows Holly Golightly, a naive but alluring country girl turned cafe society girl in NYC who makes a living socialising with wealthy men.</p>

	<p>I loved that Holly wasn’t your typical literary heroine. She was truly a wild thing that didn’t need or want to be saved by a man, which is where the film adaptation strayed furthest from the original. In this novella, there wasn’t really any moral to the story, and that was so refreshing.</p>
