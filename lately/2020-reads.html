<p>I read 80 books this year. These were the best of them.</p>
  
<p><b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52222275">Exhalation</a> by Ted Chiang</b></p>

	<p>A speculative fiction collection.</p>

	<p>Chiang blends science and philosophy, taking speculative fiction beyond an exploration of fantastical futures to lay bare the multiple truths of what humanity is and has always been. A common theme throughout the collection was the idea of free will. What struck me was the recognition of the indifference of the universe, the insignificance of humanity, and the persistent delusion of hope we depend on.</p>
  
<p><b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27071490-homegoing">Homegoing</a> by Yaa Gyasi</b></p>

	<p>The legacies of two Ghanian half-sisters who are born into different villages—one married off into a life of comfort and one sold into slavery.</p>

	<p>I rarely find myself contemplating the form of a story, but this was the most uniquely structured one I've come across in awhile. Each chapter was written from the perspective of a different character with two chapters from each generation, one from each sister's side. With this structure, Gyasi was able to cover a great expanse of time, connecting history to the present. The blurb said it best: "<i>Homegoing</i> makes history visceral, and acptures, with singular and stunning immediacy, how the memory of captivity came to be inscribed in the soul of a nation."</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35051839">Pachinko</a> by Min Jin Lee</b></p>

	<p>A multigenerational story following a Korean family in Japan from the Japanese annexation of Korea in 1910 to WWII, the Korean War, and beyond.</p>

	<p>한 <i>(han)</i> is that untranslatable feeling of hope and suffering that every Korean knows. But this book comes pretty close (in fact, the Dutch title for <i>Pachinko</i> is <i>Han</i>). It's about so many things, but what it always came back to for me was home, that complicated thing neither here nor there.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36127488-front-desk">Front Desk</a> by Kelly Yang</b></p>

	<p>A Chinese immigrant story following 10yo Mia Tang—front desk manager at the Calivista Motel and aspiring writer.</p>

	<p>This middle grade novel had so much heart, touching on so many real and heavy topics—such as how immigrant workers are taken advantage of, poverty, fear of safety, harmful "positive" stereotypes, anti-black racism in the Asian community, and more—without feeling moralistic or contrived. I cried about a bike.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28439264-spaceman">Spaceman</a> by Mike Massimino</b></p>

	<p>Memoir of an astronaut.</p>

	<p>This was an exhilarating read. It made me laugh. It made me cry. The way Massimino talked about community and overcoming failture resonated with me deeply. Plus, space is cool.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22822858-a-little-life">A Little Life</a> by Hanya Yanagihara</b></p>

	<p>An intimate story of trauma and friendship, following Jude and his three friends in New York City.</p>

	<p>Harrowing. Relentless. There were so many times I had to put the book down, sometimes because I was sick to my stomach, sometimes because I wanted to hold onto the respite of a tender moment for as long as possible, putting off the devastation I knew was to come but still couldn’t fathom. It was a total obliteration. Not in a glorious burst, but by a quiet disappearance into myself. I would never subject someone to a recommendation, but never have I been so consumed by a story.</p>
