<p>The holidays aren't complete without skating at a public rink, or so I've heard. Personally, I've always wondered what was so fun about ice skating. Doesn't it get boring skating in circles?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I accompanied a friend who was dying to go. I soon discovered that ice skating involves too much fighting for survival for boredom. Everyone was either struggling or with someone who was struggling. Me? I was the one struggling.</p>

<p>Luckily I had my friend to guide me along the ice... ish. As I stepped onto the rink behind her, the floor slipped from under me and the next foot scrambled to get its holding. I zeroed in on the closest available strip of railing and stretched myself over the other struggling bodies. As I inched myself around the rink, my friend wound back to find me. "I thought you said you skated before??"</p>

<p>Yeah, like four years ago! Let me tell you, ice skating is not like riding a bike! So it was as if I was taking my first steps all over again, complete with my friend skating ahead then turning around to urge me toward her, like an expectant mama.</p>

<p>I’m proud to say that I didn’t fall once! I attribute my success to my skills in self-preservation. People falling in my periphery? SWERVE! People about to fall in front of me? SWERVE! (And watch on helplessly as they tumble behind me.) Little kid losing balance and dangling limply from their parent’s grasp? SWERVE! Caught in a thick crowd of chaos? Stand still and wait for them to dissipate! (And hope that the whiz kid streaking through the small spaces doesn’t knock me over.)</p>

<p>But the best skill of all? Learning to laugh. Through the wobbles. Through the near misses. At yourself. At your friend. Brushing it off. Trooping onward. To nowhere in particular. Simply enjoying this silly journey.</p>
