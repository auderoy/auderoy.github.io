  <div class="chapter-title">Another way to build a habit</div>

<p>I swam three times a week every week for eight months. Then I slipped to two times a week. Then one. Then none. Naturally and completely undramatically, I asked myself, "Will I ever dip my toes in a pool again?"</p>

<p>Serendipitously, I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/21/smarter-living/tips-better-morning-routine.html">this article</a> in the <i>New York Times</i> about the morning routines of high achievers, and it couldn't have come at a more opportune time. It suggested habits for everyone to try, one of which was to not beat yourself up. The high achievers that were interviewed didn't consider missing days of their morning routines as failures, as long as they got back to it as soon as they could; they recognised that sometimes they would miss their routines, and that was okay.</p>

<p>This is why when people say to "be kind to yourself" or "be more forgiving of yourself," they aren't just saying empty platitudes to comfort and coddle you. When you are kind and forgiving of yourself, you find the peace of mind to pick yourself up and carry on.</p>

<p>The article juxtaposed this strategy with Jerry Seinfeld's "don't break the chain" method for productivity, in which "if there's a certain task you want to do every day, you can keep yourself accountable by putting a red 'x' over every day you complete this task on a large wall calendar," soon creating a chain for which your only job will be to not break it. The article questions the efficacy of this method because "it doesn't allow for occasional, yet inevitable, failures."</p>

<p>This resonated deeply with me because there have been so many times that I've given up a habit-in-progress due to this perceived failure. I'd give 30 Days of Yoga with Adriene a go, last for five days, miss one, drop it for a year, and maybe give it another try, but only to drop it again. I'd give learning French on Duolingo a try, puff up with pride as I saw my streak go up every day, then deflate and give it up as soon as I missed a day and my streak went back to zero.</p>

<p>But what if those weren't endings, merely intermissions? What if instead of building habits with rigour, we built them with kindness and forgiveness?</p>
