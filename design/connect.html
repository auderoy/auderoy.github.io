  <div class="chapter-title">Connecting students to Philly</div>

<p>Penn is located in University City, just a few minutes outside Center City Philadelphia. Despite the close proximity, students find themselves stuck in the college bubble and don't take as much advantage of the city as they could, missing out on potentially enriching experiences.</p>

<p>How might we encourage Penn students to know the City of Brotherly Love and Penn's place in it?</p>

<p><h2>Empathise</h2></p>

<p>The initial interview took place in class. However, what was interesting to notice is that all the students in class were business or engineering majors, so I also conducted interviews outside of class to reach a wider variety of students, including architecture majors, fine arts majors, and urban studies majors. From these interviews, I constructed the persona of Grace, an upperclassman who is artistic and interested in exploring Philly, as she is considering to move to Philly upon graduation. The reasons for this decision are that it's close enough to home (New York) for comfort, but far enough from home for independence, and she has developed a familiarity with Philly from her years studying nearby, but also has a sense of adventure about the city, knowing that there are many aspects of the city she hasn't experienced yet.</p>

<h2>Define</h2>

<p>Grace is interested in exploring the city freely, but a lack of structure makes it difficult to plan trips into the city and takes more time than she cares to spare. A successful solution would encourage and focus her existing motivations for exploring the city by providing a goal, but still allow her to explore on her own terms. We will know it has worked when she learns about, visits, and recalls a higher quantity of new/unique places in Philly.</p>

<h2>Ideate</h2>

<p>There were several practical ideations, such as subsidising transportation, subsidising entrance fees, officiating a transportation-share program, and integrating a Philly aspect into the curriculum, but I needed to focus on creating an experienceâ€”one that would help Grace feel some ownership and familiarity with the city, and also encourage her to continue exploring. I decided to tap into her artistic inclinations.</p>

<h2>Prototype</h2>

<p>"Philly Street View" is like a DIY Google Street View, and users can create their Street View like filling in a puzzle.</p>

<h2>Test</h2>

<p>It became apparent that a student pressed for time would not spare any to complete a photographic map. A photographic map is simply too large-scale of a project. Furthermore, it would require photographic details such as streets and all the in-between places, whereas the user is more interested in (new) destinations.</p>

<h2>Prototype</h2>

<p>"Draw My Philly" is a web app that creates custom illustrated maps, given photographs. The program then renders the photos onto the map with a cohesive aesthetic using computer vision.</p>

<h2>Test</h2>

<p>Although "Draw My Philly" is also a little finnicky, it is much less so than "Philly Street View." Additionally, it puts the focus on the destination and requires much less from the user. It appeals greater to her artistic inclinations with its illustrative quality, personalised to her own artistic style.</p>

<p>In the future, this project can be expanded for multiple users and allow them to upload their own mood boards to personalise their aesthetic. This expansion would also open the platform up to a social aspect and allow users to share profiles/maps in app.</p>
