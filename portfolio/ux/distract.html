<div id="uxproj-desc"> <!-- https://fnar234.infojawn.xyz/lecture-11/ -->
  <p>The devices we wear and carry with us on a daily basis are distracting us from the world around us. Fear of missing out (FOMO) drives people to constantly check email, answer text messages, and spend hours on social media sites. FOMO makes this condition worse.</p>
  <p>How might we enable people to focus on experiencing the world around them and enhancing the interpersonal relationships they have?</p>

<h2>Empathize</h2>
<p>The initial interview took place in class. I got a feel of what users felt was important and/or got more excited sharing about. During the user group interview, users seemed to be passionate about social media usage, particularly of Instagram and of Instagram Stories. Outside of class, as an additional interview, I wanted to find someone who had similar phone usage habits in that sense so that I could build of the previous findings, and followed up with that one person when I found them. This person was Sarah.</p>
<h2>Define</h2>
<p>Once the interviews were complete, I recognized patterns and prioritized problems. The greatest motivation Sarah had to minimize distractions was to focus on academics. Her problem was that she would turn to her phone for easy distractions rather than face these challenges (homework), which would subsequently lead to her losing track of and wasting time.</p>
<p>A successful solution would encourage her to be more intentional with her time by way of setting intervals to introduce conscious choice into her experience, in order to refocus and refresh rather than distract.</p>
<h2>Ideate</h2>
<p>My ideations ranged in focus from the online/the device to the offline/real life interactions. Sharing these ideations in class for feedback, there was excitement for the feature of tracking user behavior and incorporating machine learning. The idea born from this was to track users' habits, i.e. reading speed, tracking frequency of tab switching, etc., and then use that information as data for the system to learn and predict users' habits.</p>
<p>The winning idea was "Work Smart," the "smart" Pomodoro technique. The concept was based on the Pomodoro technique, a proven time management method that breaks down work into intervals. Our application takes it a step further and optimizes unique intervals using machine learning based on habits of the specific user.</p>
<h2>Prototype</h2>
<p>There was the question of whether to focus on improving the online by making work time more productive, or to focus on improving the offline by making break time more healthy. By focusing on intervals, I was able to account for both and connect work sessions and break sessions. Not only did intervals answer the question of when to take breaks, but it also opened the opportunity to distinguish between "tech free" breaks and "with tech" breaks, answering the question of what could be done during breaks.</p>
<h2>Test</h2>
<p>The topic of "minimizing distraction" felt inherently contradictory, which was difficult for me to come to terms with and begin to think of solutions for. In general, the cause for distraction was technology, but I was to come up with a technological solution. It would seem that the most straightforward thing to do would be to use less technology overall, which would be a non-technological solution. Furthermore, Sarah shared that she preferred manual methods of time/technology manangement, i.e. physically distancing herself from her phone, rather than downloading an app to manage it for her; she also found manual management methods more fulfilling.</p>
<p>For that reason, the initial prototype did not have any sort of reward/incentive system, thinking that the presentation of choice and the reward of completing a task would be a reward in itself. However, a stronger reward/incentive was needed, which took the form of a work summary that presented statistics upon ending an app session.</p>
